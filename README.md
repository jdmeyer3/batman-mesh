# batman-mesh

The batman mesh network relies upon two nodes talking to one another. This code is for nodes that will communicate via a wifi access point. When the wifi ap are connected and the wifi network interface is bridging to 
the bat0 interface, the batman nodes will begin to talk to one another.
